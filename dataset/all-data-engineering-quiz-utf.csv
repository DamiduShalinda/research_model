Compare and contrast the challenges of Batch processing and Stream processing.,"When managing large datasets, batch processing and stream processing each come with unique challenges based on their methods and use cases.

1. Batch Processing Challenges:

Latency: Batch processing collects data over a set period, so results are delayed until the entire batch is processed. This latency can delay insights, making it less suitable for real-time decision-making.
Resource Spikes: Processing large batches periodically can create resource spikes, requiring substantial computational power for a limited time.
Storage Needs: Since data is collected before processing, batch processing typically requires significant storage to hold unprocessed data until the batch is ready.
Error Detection and Handling: Errors are often detected only after processing the entire batch, which can complicate troubleshooting and increase the time needed to address issues.
Data Freshness: Since data is processed at intervals, batch processing lacks real-time updates, limiting its use in applications needing immediate insights.
2. Stream Processing Challenges:

Real-time Requirements: Stream processing demands low latency to process data as it is generated, requiring robust infrastructure to handle continuous, rapid data flows.
Scalability: Scaling stream processing to manage high data throughput is complex and demands a system that can adjust to fluctuating data volumes.
Fault Tolerance and Error Handling: Errors need immediate handling to avoid disruption in real-time data flow, which requires advanced fault tolerance mechanisms.
Event Order and Consistency: Ensuring data is processed in the correct order and maintaining consistency in the face of potential delays or out-of-order events is challenging.
Cost of Infrastructure: Real-time processing infrastructure can be costly, as it needs to handle constant, high-speed data ingestion and processing without downtime.

Great amount is processed through as batches as batch. Stream Processing means the data is processed at real-time, continuously as the data received.

So when comparing the Batch processing with Stream processing the stream processing more complex when comparing with batch processing as stream processing is realtime, and stream processing is mostly an automated one as it should be done realtime.

As the Batch processing is processed as batch in a certain interval of time (hourly, daily, weekly etc), we have a certain interval of time for data processing, but stream processing data is processed at the real-time data is received. So stream processing is more complex when comparing to batch processing in the concern of timing.

As stream processing is directly delivered as output in real-time, we don’t even have time to be automated. Stream processing should be well structured with pre-processing to clean the data accordingly.

The first step of ETL is Extraction (E) phase in there we mainly focus on extracting data from various sources. If we consider a scenario like a supplier is analyzing delivered supply data. They first need to extract necessary data from supermarkets where they have delivered the products. Some of those are many supermarkets the data given by them can be varying according to their operational systems. In some cases we may need to get data from web endpoints like API. Some supermarkets some will give via Excel sheet and some will give those purchases in PDF documents. In the extraction process we need to implement suitable methods to extract those data from varying sources. We may need to create custom scripts like python scripts or use various tools to gather those data from those sources. Sometimes we need to use machine learning solutions. After extracting like Azure document intelligence to extract details from the PDF documents that the supermarkets provide.

After successfully extracting those data, then we move into the transformation phase. In here we basically do the transforming those gathered data from various sources to a format that we need. In here data processing step happens. For example different supermarkets have used different names for a same product in the transform stage we need to identify those and correct them to a single naming standard. In this step also enriching can happen, for example maybe check the address of those supermarket are embedded inside. Some of third-party service like google map API to get the exact geo-coordinates of those shop notes to future processing. Hence data enriching also happens in transform stage.

After transforming then the data is loaded (L) to the data warehouse or data lake according to the requirement. In here we do the analytics for the gathered data. In our example we do the data loading to be future data processing and do analytics on how the sales data across the supermarket chains. As we have now the sales data and also by geo-coordinates of the shops we can use them to optimize the delivery in the analyzed data.",3,3,4

3. Load

In extract stage, data from different source systems are accessed in order to transfer these data to another place, probably a data warehouse. In this stage, we could access data from multiple sources. Sources could be different, for example, operational databases, flat files, APIs. After accessing data from these source systems, those data are stored in a staging area. This is basically known as extraction. Extraction could be done in different ways; we could extract data batch-wise after a predefined time interval, or we could extract all data from the source system.

Then at the transformation stage, we transform extracted data to make them suitable for storing in the data warehouse. Since we extracted data from different source systems to the staging area, those data are in different formats. Therefore, we should transform those data to make sure all data are in the standard format.

After transformation, we could load data to the data warehouse or the desired location. Loading also could be done in different ways, such as incremental load, full load. In incremental load, we load only the updated or new records for the data warehouse, but in full load, we erase everything in the destination and load everything again.",3,4,4

We have to standardize the collected data into one place, and with similar collection techniques, every time. Additionally, we have to exchange or adjust the protocols to collect data from various data sources.

Another major problem arises when these data collected are in raw form, which means it is not ready for analytic usage or storage. We need to process and transform that data to be ready for analytical operations or store for future analytic purposes where data warehouses, data lakes, etc., come into play.

Next problem was storage. When the data in data warehouses and data lakes gets messy, we need to ensure larger amounts of data storage. Most of the organization collected all the past data to do analytics, to help organization decision-making, but it contains large amounts of data, and that amount of data organization needs robust infrastructure like high-speed connections or hardware and for maintaining the data schedule, need robust distributed data storage systems. This kind of complicated system development and monitoring is very important and needs highly skilled engineers.

When applying a design pattern to a specific problem, the first step is to analyze the situation thoroughly. This involves identifying recurring issues or bottlenecks in the software design, such as unmanageable object dependencies or redundant code structures. Once the nature of the problem is clear, the next step is to choose an appropriate pattern from the existing catalog—whether it be one of the creational patterns (like Singleton or Factory Method) to address object instantiation challenges, one of the structural patterns (like Adapter or Composite) to manage complex object interactions, or one of the behavioral patterns (like Observer or Strategy) to organize the responsibilities and communication flow between objects.

After selecting the matching pattern, developers adapt it to the specific context of their application. This flexibility is one of the greatest strengths of design patterns: each pattern serves as a proven foundation that can be customized to suit particular requirements. The final step is implementation, where the pattern is integrated into the project’s codebase to ensure the problem is resolved without causing ripple effects in other parts of the application.

When applying a design pattern to a specific problem, the first step is to analyze the situation thoroughly. This involves identifying recurring issues or bottlenecks in the software design, such as unmanageable object dependencies or redundant code structures. Once the nature of the problem is clear, the next step is to choose an appropriate pattern from the existing catalog—whether it be one of the creational patterns (like Singleton or Factory Method) to address object instantiation challenges, one of the structural patterns (like Adapter or Composite) to manage complex object interactions, or one of the behavioral patterns (like Observer or Strategy) to organize the responsibilities and communication flow between objects.

After selecting the matching pattern, developers adapt it to the specific context of their application. This flexibility is one of the greatest strengths of design patterns: each pattern serves as a proven foundation that can be customized to suit particular requirements. The final step is implementation, where the pattern is integrated into the project’s codebase to ensure the problem is resolved without causing ripple effects in other parts of the application.

So, when we use programming languages, we can use classes, object properties, and methods. Thus, we create the software according to a template that defines these properties and methods.

In object-oriented programming (OOP), we can use many objects, and they are connected to each other. We can use these objects to create the software and provide the solution that is related to the software. When we use objects (methods and properties), they have behavioral design patterns.

So, when we use design patterns, we use their use cases and implementation. When we provide a solution for a real-world problem, we need to choose the best design pattern.

Instead of embedding the logic for creating every type of employee throughout the code, the Factory Method centralizes object creation in one place often called a “factory” or a “factory method.” This factory determines which type of employee object to instantiate based on input parameters, while the rest of the system simply requests an “employee” without worrying about which subtype is being created. By delegating the creation logic to a dedicated class or method, the application becomes more modular and easier to maintain.

Therefore, we have to select objects according to properties. There are two types of properties for an object:

Common properties
Specific properties
Example: Different objects but the same behaviors.
In this scenario, the object has:

Name, age, address, contact number, etc. (common properties).
Then in the factory design pattern, we can consider all the common behaviors as a group overall together (common behaviors = working, meeting).
But there are different types of specific properties:

Employee: Employee ID
Contractor: Contractor ID, contractor agreement
Intern: Intern ID, intern duration
Executive: Executive level
(Specific behavior = working hours).

Likewise, creating working hours for part-time by designing and separating employees using objects with behavior is important because of that.

Explain how proxy design pattern can be implemented to solve database authorization?,"The Proxy Design Pattern is a structural design pattern that places a “proxy” (or stand-in) object between a client and a real service object in order to manage or enhance the way the client interacts with that service. In a database authorization scenario, the relevant form of proxy is commonly known as a protection proxy, which checks the user’s credentials and permissions before allowing any direct operations on sensitive data. By doing so, it ensures that only authorized personnel can modify or retrieve information from the database.

When implementing a protection proxy for database authorization, the proxy class sits between the client (e.g., a piece of application code or a user interface) and the actual database connection or query object. When a client issues a request—such as “delete a record” or “retrieve a record”—the proxy intercepts this request and consults an authorization component. This component checks if the client’s credentials match the required privileges. For instance, if the user is an administrator, they may be granted permissions to delete or modify records, whereas standard users can only read or query specific entries. Should the credentials fail these checks, the proxy prevents the request from reaching the real database, thereby safeguarding data integrity and security.

This approach makes it unnecessary for the rest of the system to embed complicated authorization logic. Instead, the proxy encapsulates these rules, effectively separating security concerns from business logic. Additionally, this structure is easily extensible: if new roles, permission sets, or auditing requirements are introduced, one can simply update the proxy’s authorization checks without touching the core database operations. By centralizing all security checks in the protection proxy, developers maintain a cleaner, more consistent, and more secure codebase, illustrating why the Proxy Design Pattern is ideal for handling database authorization in many enterprise-level applications.","The Proxy Design Pattern is a structural design pattern, and the implementation of a proxy does vary depending on the type of proxy being used: virtual, remote, protection, or caching etc. The proxy design pattern is about using a proxy object to control access to another object. This can be useful in various scenarios where you want to either defer the creation of an object, add security checks, or simply access remote resources.

As an implementation of a proxy, one of the things is authorization. This is called a ""protection proxy.""

An authorization proxy controls access to an object based on permissions or access rights. This is useful when you have sensitive operations/data and want to ensure that only authorized users can access/modify it.

In many systems (like database record manipulation), we need to restrict access to certain features/data. For instance, only admin users should be able to delete/modify certain records, while other users can only view them. Without protection, unauthorized users may perform actions that compromise data integrity/security.

When DB authentication is used, usernames, root passwords, or tokens grant the security regarding data access.",2,4,5
"How can facade design pattern be used to process booking a vacation package that involves flight booking, hotel reservation, and car rentals?","The Facade Design Pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a group of complex subsystems. In the scenario of booking a vacation package, there are typically three distinct processes flight booking, hotel reservation, and car rentals which all have different behaviors and complexities. Rather than exposing all these complexities to the user or other parts of the application, the facade design pattern allows these separate systems to be accessed through a single, straightforward interface.

When considering flight booking, there are multiple tasks that must be handled behind the scenes. For instance, the flight booking subsystem needs to gather traveler information, verify passport details, select seats, and process ticket payments. These steps can be complicated, especially if there are various flight options, seat classes, and airline policies. The same kind of intricacy appears in the hotel reservation subsystem, where travelers must select room types, confirm availability, pick check-in and check-out dates, and handle meal or amenity preferences. Finally, the car rental subsystem deals with choosing a suitable car model, verifying driving license details, selecting pickup and drop-off locations, and potentially adding insurance or mileage packages.

Because each subsystem handles a distinct portion of the overall vacation booking process and requires specific interactions, directly communicating with all three can be cumbersome. The Facade solves this by exposing a single interface often called a “Vacation Package Facade” through which all these operations can be requested at once. Instead of forcing the user or calling code to understand the intricacies of each subsystem, the facade takes the input from the user and orchestrates all the necessary steps: it confirms flight availability and payment, reserves the hotel room, and secures the rental car. This approach hides complex details and streamlines the booking flow.

Ultimately, by employing the Facade Design Pattern, the process of booking a complete vacation package is unified under one umbrella. Users or client applications only see a clean, high-level method (for example, “bookVacationPackage”), and all the granular tasks related to flights, hotels, and car rentals happen behind the scenes.
